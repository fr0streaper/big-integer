# Big integer arithmetic implementation for C++
This was implemented for a C++ course at ITMO University

The presented version contains both 2nd and 3rd homeworks in it, the only difference between them is the type of container used - std::vector in 2nd and ad-hoc storage in 3rd

The approximate runtime on the tests is 2.5 seconds
